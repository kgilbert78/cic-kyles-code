Terminal in new empty folder called addServer & type:
    npm init -y
to create package.json

install express:
    npm i -s
i for install, s for save. Save so when I run it, it will be added to my package.json file.
Once added to package.json anyone I send this code to can run npm i and the right packages will be installed.
Once this installs you see express show up in dependencies object in package.json

To run server & access it
type in terminal:
    node app.js
Go to browser and type: 
    localhost:3000/hello
(or other endpoint created in file)

Use nodemon to reboot server when you change your code, so you only have to refresh your browser to see changes:
    npm i -s nodemon
Shows up in dependencies object in package.json
To run the code to run the server now, type:
    npx nodemon app.js
npx installs nodemon temporarily to run it or if you have it on your computer, it uses that local copy to run it.

Body parser for interpretting stuff sent in post requests:
    npm i -s body-parser

Fetch with back end localhost address
