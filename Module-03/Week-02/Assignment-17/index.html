            I can use a CSS class in my stylesheet to change the alignment here, but not in the h1 where I used the bootstrap class text-center! Even an an ID tag in my stylesheet will not change this!

        <p>and this text is right under it because I set the bottom margin on the line above to 0 using bootstrap.</p>
        <p>Here is a paragraph without a bootstrap class in the p tag for comparison.</p>

                <strong>What components/classes you used</strong>
                <p>
                    Bootstrap classes: m for margin t for top such as mt-5, p for padding such as pt-2, text size such as fs-3, texct-center, text-uppercase and text-capitalize.
                    <br/>
                    My own components: margin, text align, font size, color.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>If you have any questions or had any trouble</strong>
                <p>Is there a way to override bootstrap's text alignment or margin for one portion of text? I suppose the easiest solution is to use bootstrap for these functions throughout.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Anything extra you did that you are proud of/learned</strong>
                <p>I was pleased that I thought of inserting a span and assigning a different class to the span, and it worked to override bootstrap classes on the div it was within.</p>
